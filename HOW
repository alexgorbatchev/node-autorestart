how to develop with node js on linux:

basic knowledge of linux to run node js.
 where can you get it? here:

please notice this guide is not tested but it is probably a very very good hint.

i found it a convinient way to work:

now i am developing on windows,
with vmware, linux with samba and ssh.
and i use PsPad to edit files and Putty for ssh (i set win window lines scrollback to 20000)

some other notes:
how to choose a secure password: i use a sentense method, it is like you type a password as a sentense of words without spaces.
example iamusingdevserver or ilovemywife iambatman
i have started to use samba on all my servers i find it easier then ftp.

download some virtual pc software like:

vmware's    vmware server - it is free, or vmware workstation if you like.
sun's       virtual-box - witch is very good and free also
microsoft's virtual pc - is also free.
probably there are more virtualisation programs, instead you might want to rent a vps or set it up on your real server. 

make some folder on windows click properties and make its contents compressed.

open your virtual pc software 

setup an ubuntu server on a 10 GB disk virtual machine with 256 mb of memory or even less.
usualy it does not take more then 64 to run and not more then 120 to boot.
however on production system it might be good to run it on a computer with 900mb of memory.
because v8 reserves just for fun 850 mb of memory or virtual memory at start 

set root password:

sudo su
passwd


login as root.


install open ssh server:

aptitude install openssh-server


install samba:

aptitude install samba

now download Putty  - ssh client
and connect to server with putty as root.

mouse left click and select text copies the text to clipboard
mouse right click - pastes the text  

configure samba:

add a user to samba
smbpasswd -a root

type your password.

nano /etc/samba/smb.conf

add the folowing to the end of the file (create new share): 

with keyboard page down until the end
copy the folowing add some newlines with enter and right click to paste it.

[root]
   comment = System Share
   path = /
   guest ok = no ; or yes if it is in vmware
   browseable = yes
   create mask = 0777
   directory mask = 0777
   read only = no

to save and exit from the nano editor you press Control + X 
... see the shortcut keys at bottom of screen.


to restart samba execute:

restart smbd

to use samba windows network files share you type from windows
\\hostname_or_ipaddress of your server or virtual server.

it might feel at first unfamiular but you can do:

\\mywebsite.com and get the folder in windows explorer


go to /var/www and work there or in some other folder.



to install git:
aptitude install git-core


how to use github:
http://help.github.com/creating-a-repo/
http://help.github.com/msysgit-key-setup/


to install node.js

go to user home folder:
cd ~/

http://nodejs.org/#download
right click on download url and copy url shortcut
http://nodejs.org/dist/node-v0.1.99.tar.gz

in ssh type:
wget , and right click, you will have:
wget http://nodejs.org/dist/node-v0.1.99.tar.gz

to extract the file you type 
tar -vxf and press tab to use auto complete
you will have:
tar -vxf node-v0.1.99.tar.gz 

now enter to the nodejs's folder:
cd + no+press tab several times
you will have:
cd node-v0.1.99

then do like in manual the normal steps of compiling and installing a software from source on linux:
./configure
make
make install

(side note: the default modules folder is at : /usr/local/lib/node )

notice the ./ before configure
it means to execute a script in the current folder
to make script executable (if it is not) you can type chmod +x yourfilename
then you can do ./yourfilename


how to use autoexit continued in README file.


now you know how to install software , this way you can install mongodb and nginx.
